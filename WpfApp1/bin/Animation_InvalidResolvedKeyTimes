Resolved KeyTime for key frame at index {1} cannot be greater than resolved KeyTime for key frame at index {4}. KeyFrames[{1}] has specified KeyTime '{2}', which resolves to time {3}; KeyFrames[{4}] has specified KeyTime '{5}', which resolves to time {6}. Some KeyTimes are resolved relative to Begin time of '{0}' and others relative to its Duration, so some sets of KeyTimes are not valid for all Durations.
